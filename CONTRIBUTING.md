# Contributing

This is a school project that we will stop caring about in December 2017! We do not really require any help. However, if you *really* want to do something, find some bug, or whatever, just feel free to open an issue or fork it, do whatever you want under our license, and open a pull request.

I can't believe it one single second, but if this ever happens, if anyone ever ***dares*** trying to contribute to this project and find it useful in any way, maybe, ***maybe***, we will write proper contributing guidelines.

In the meantime, why don't you just go find some other more interesting projects?
